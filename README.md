Stainless Steel Alloy Corrosion (SStAC) 
=====

SStAC have been developed to assist in part design, reducing costs by eliminating the need for conservative material selection, and enabling alloy optimization to improve corrosion resistance, which:

- Can model corrosion of valve steels in an engine environment at temperatures up to 800 C.
- Can simulate the corrosion of an engine valve in 1D for a fast estimate of the corrosion rate and in 2D and 3D for more detailed simulations that represent the valve geometry and predict the precise location and rate of corrosion.
- Is implemented using the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE).
- Employs a corrosion model that is being developed to describe the fundamental mechanisms of corrosion, including the impact of microstructure and alloy composition.
